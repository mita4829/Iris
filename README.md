# Iris

## Description
The goal of this project is to design an iOS app to allow blind people to more easily read text that doesn't have accompanying braille. Users can take a picture of the text with their iPhone, and Iris will convert the text to pseudo-braille and the user can interpret with vibrations on their iPhone.
